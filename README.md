# UNIF

This repository contains the archived source code of UNIF, a unification algorithm developped in 1974 at IRIA by Gérard Huet. 
UNIF source code can be discovered via two different angles, materialized as two different branches. 

## Main Branch

The main branch contains the original materials as well as the metada linked to UNIF. 
The original finds are stored in the Depository containing the raw materials.
- Folder [raw materials](./raw_materials) is for the original [source code](./raw_materials/source_code) materials, as they have been found or submitted, as well as some [ancillary documents](./raw_materials/additional_material). 
  - [source_code](./raw_materials/source_code) contains a scanned listing of the UNIF source code as well as a README file containing an execution example, both from 1974. 
  - [additional_material](./raw_materials/additional_material) contains the [historical publication](./raw_materials/additional_material/unification_algorithm_typed_lamda_calc.pdf) _A unification algorithm for typed lambda-calculus, 
Theoretical Computer Science 1 (1975) 27-57._ on which UNIF was based, as well as some [personnal recollections](./raw_materials/additional_material/GH_memoires.pdf) from Gérard Huet. 
  
- Folder [metadata](/.metadata) holds various files with meta information to be updated throughout the process. 


## SourceCode Branch
The SourceCode branch is a standalone view on the historical source code.


# The process

This repository was created by Software Heritage team, with the support of the Software Heritage Acquisition Process (SWHAP). All the raw materials were provided by Gérard Huet and are also presented on his [personnal page](https://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/soft.html). 

For general considerations about the process, check out the [SWHAP guide](https://www.softwareheritage.org/swhap/) as initially published in 2019 with UNESCO.
For a detailed step by step description of the process, check out the [SWHAP@Inria guide](https://github.com/mathfichen/swhapguide). The SWHAP@Inria guide is itself a simplified version of the step by step [SHWAP@Pisa guide](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf) published by the university of Pisa.
